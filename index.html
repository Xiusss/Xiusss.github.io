        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Fabrizio Sulpizio, a computer engineer with a passion that pulses in pixels and a heart that beats in binary. From the earliest lines of code I wrote, I found myself drawn to the enchanting world of gamesâ€”a space where technology dances with imagination.

For me, games are more than just entertainment; they're immersive experiences, canvases waiting to be filled with innovation and emotion. With a foundation in computer engineering, I seamlessly blend the technical with the artistic, crafting experiences that linger long after the controller is set down.

Venturing beyond the ordinary, I've delved into the realm of Virtual Reality, shaping experiences that go beyond entertainment. My expertise in serious game development through VR reflects my commitment to harnessing the power of games for education, training, and social impact. In the worlds I create, learning becomes an adventure, and growth is gamified.

Now, I'm on a mission to turn my passion into a profession. I don't just want to be a game designer or developer; I aim to be a storyteller who crafts worlds that captivate, challenge, and inspire. It's not just about writing code for me; it's about weaving narratives that resonate, characters that breathe, challenges that spark growth. And games that are worth to play. 

Let's gather up on this epic quest, where lines of code become spells, and algorithms shape destinies. If you're seeking a game designer or developer who doesn't just play games but lives and breathes them, I'm ready. Let the game begin!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there, I'm Fabrizio Sulpizio, a computer engineer with a deep fascination for the intersection of technology, gaming, and psychology. My journey is rooted in the belief that there's more to games than just pixels and code; they hold the power to tap into the intricacies of the human mind. With a background in Computer engineering, I've come to see games as more than mere entertainment. They're intricate systems that mirror the complexities of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. My skill set, developed through working with tools like Unity and Blender, allows me to not only understand the technical side of gaming but also to explore how these virtual experiences influence us on a psychological level. My goal is simple yet profoundâ€”to contribute to the evolving landscape where gaming and psychology converge. I see games as a unique medium to delve into the human psyche, understanding how decisions made in a virtual world can reflect and impact our real-world selves. It's not about creating games for the sake of escapism but rather crafting experiences that resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level.
            In this ever-evolving realm, I aim to bridge the gap between the virtual and the real. Each line of code becomes a narrative thread, and every game played is an exploration of the intricacies of human behavior. I'm on a journey to contribute to the emerging field of game psychology, exploring how technology can be harnessed to not only entertain but also to understand and shape our cognitive processes.
            Join me in this exploration at the crossroads of computer engineering, gaming, and psychology, where the quest for understanding the human mind is as thrilling as the games we create.</p>
